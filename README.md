### /code

This is a folder of example code and learning resource links that I used, no practice code was written as I did all of the practicing in-app while i was building the project.

#### **python**

[30 days of Python repo](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) by [Asabeneh](https://github.com/Asabeneh)

I used parts of this wonderful repo to help learn key parts of python over the past 9 weeks of this course.

#### **tkinter**

I used a few different sources for learning tkinter, each with their own little nuggets of gold throughout.

[tkinter docs](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/widgets.html) were vital throughout the process for referring back to time and time again

[real python](https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/) was also invaluable as a starting point for the project.

[tkinter by example](https://github.com/Dvlv/Tkinter-By-Example) by [Dvlv](https://github.com/Dvlv) was also very useful for understanding key concepts especially with example code.

### /my-code

#### **helpdesk-ticketing-system**

These are the files written for the [helpdesk ticketing project](https://github.com/Cody-Derbyshire/helpdesk-ticketing-system), main.py is the command-line interface version of the app, and gui.py is the gui version of the app.
